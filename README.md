## Script 1

### Purpose of the Script 

The purpose of the script is to accept a URL file or local file or information from people that then turns that information into users and created users, passwords and puts them into groups and folders depending on the information provided. It also provides their birth date which is used to create the password.

### Running the Script

Script 1 can be run by opening up the a putty session using ```gateway@ict.op.ac.nz``` at the port number of ```46815```

To run the script in the putty session you use the command ```nano task1.sh``` and in the file 'BSA_Assessment_Task1.tar' in task 1 folder copy the code in. To run the script you first need to use ```chmod 700 task1.sh``` to change the permissions on the file. Finally to run the script the command is ```sudo ./task1.sh``` then either put the file after that or after running the script it will ask you for it. I add sudo infront of the command so that the commands work properly with permissions.
